# A-Level-NEA---Autonomous-Car
Project - Menu Option that allows user to pick between running simulation and creating a new map.
Project Background
Autonomous cars or self-driving cars are vehicles that can sense their environment and react by moving safely with no human input. These do not require human input and allow them to get from one point to another without having to drive. It would require heavy application of artificial intelligence to program, particularly machine learning. Many car companies such as Waymo are working on developing these cars.
The problem is that these self-driving cars are not widely available yet, as there are still flaws with the idea of a fully autonomous car driving on real streets. Although autopilot is available for some cars, such as Tesla models, they have still not fully developed a car which can fully drive from one place to another by itself.
There are also many ethical issues that arise when a self-driving car is on the road. For example, if the car is presented with an ethical problem, such as choosing the safety of one party over another, decisions have to be made on what to do.
Autonomous cars use neural networks and genetic algorithms to steer around a track, by using sensors as inputs to decide what action should be taken at each moment. My goal was to find a way to use machine learning to make a generation of cars learn how to drive around a user-made track. Simulation is one of the most important factors in developing real self-driving car, and as stated by Luca Castignani of MSC Software, ‘AI is something that lives and breathes in computers. The right place to build, train and validate this technology is the computer’. 
To help a company such as Waymo, I would have to use machine learning to put generated cars through many scenarios, which would help their research into developing these cars.
